Directions:  
Our Process Book is "Process Book.ipynb”. All of our data is found in the folder called data. You can find additional calculations in “Yelp Modeling”, “Feature Selection and Modeling”, and “Data Wrangling”. The functions countyMedian.py and addZipCodes.py, which we wrote and used to map zip codes to counties and vice versa, are included as folders in the main directory. We used one “weird” python library, called patsy (it generates design matrices) but it should import without any installations necessary.
